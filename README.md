# SW Memory Card Game

Built using React, TailwindCSS, and Vite.

Using a version of SWAPI with images, I built a memory game. In the game each card can only be clicked once, if the card is clicked twice then it is game over. Sounds easy but each click shuffles the cards randomly so the order is different everytime. 

This game is scalable so you can use as few as 4 cards, up to 60 cards. High scores are kept in state between rounds so you can try to beat the high score.
